Track name- Education

Problem Statement- If a student wants to apply for the internship, on some filtered fields then prepare a soultion to complete this work in ease and in lesser time.

Solution- We will prepare a bot using Robotics Process Automation(RPA), which will scrap the data of all the available internships from a website on which the student can apply, based on the preferenced filters of student requirements, and will update the data in a spreadsheet using that bot.
So, the student could get the filtered ineternship offers based on his preferences in a very less time.
